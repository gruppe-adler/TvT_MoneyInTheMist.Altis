# Money in the Mist
Money in the Mist is a dynamic 4-party-tvt mission for all maps.  
A *Courier* is moving through the area, making deliveries. He is carrying a *Briefcase*, that all three other parties want to secure for themselves.


## Game Flow

1. a random play zone is generated >> mission admin can repeat in case play zone isn't fair
2. all spawn points and delivery points for the *Courier* are marked on the map
3. players spawn at their respective spawn point - the *Courier* can move out instantly, the other parties have to wait a while
4. the *Briefcase* is being marked on the map in specific intervals
5. the *Courier* makes his deliveries
6. the other parties try to intercept the *Courier* and steal the *Briefcase*
7. if a party succeeds, they have to take the *Briefcase* back to an exfil point and defend it until their pick up arrives


## The Briefcase

The *Briefcase* is being tracked. In certain intervals, a marker will appear on the map, indicating the approximate position of the *Briefcase*.

The marker will appear more often and be more accurate when:

* someone other than the *Courier* is carrying the *Briefcase*
* the *Briefcase* or its carrier is in a vehicle
* no one is carrying the *Briefcase*

Notes about interacting with the *Briefcase*:

* while on the ground, it can be picked up with ACE-Interaction
* the carrier can not sprint
* if the carrier is killed, loses consciousness, surrenders or takes out a weapon, he will drop the *Briefcase*
* the *Briefcase* can not be loaded into vehicles by itself, but the carrier can mount a vehicle without dropping it
* if the carrier is killed or loses consciousness while inside a vehicle, the *Briefcase* will fall out of the vehicle
* the carrier can give the *Briefcase* to another player by ACE-Interacting with that player
* the carrier can drop the *Briefcase* with ACE-Selfinteraction


## The Courier

The *Courier* is doing his shady business delivering to other civilians or placing deliveries in dead drops. He has to complete his side missions before he can do his main delivery and win the game.

* has to complete 4 out of 6 side deliveries
* can choose to join another side if threatened with violence (ACE-Interact with enemy he wants to join)
* he can then defect from that side again and flee (ACE-Selfinteraction)
* looks just like every other civilian on the map
* starts with a vehicle that has some equipment inside
